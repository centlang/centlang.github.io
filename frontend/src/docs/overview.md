## Introduction

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with basic programming concepts and have
used another programming language before.

## Hello, world!

We'll write a simple program that prints `Hello, world!` to the screen. Create a
new file named `main.cn` with the following content:

```cent
with std::io;

fn main() {
    io::println("Hello, world!");
}
```

Now, enter these commands to compile and run the program:

```sh
$ centc main.cn
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```

You can also use the `--run` option to automatically run the compiled
executable:

```sh
$ centc main.cn --run
Hello, world!
```
